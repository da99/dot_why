Dot\_Why
=======


It uses Erector to create [Diet\_Dot](https://github.com/jamescostian/diet-dot)
templates (nodejs/js) or [Cosmo](http://cosmo.luaforge.net/) templates (lua).


You can create your own. Just look in the `lib` folder.

Warning:
=======

You probably should make your life easier and use standard templates
your framework provides.  This is too hard for you (and me).


Install:
=======

This is not worthy to be listed in gem repos, so you have to
install manually:

    gem install dot_why

    # === For rbenv users: ===
    rbenv rehash
    # ========================

    cd /my_templates/whatever
    dot_why Diet_Dot ./my_layout ./my_template

Note:
====

The layout and template files should have a `.rb` extension.

Support
======

You are on your own. I barely have time to add all the features
I want.
